# Cpp-AI_Maze_Traversal
This is an AI Maze Traversal Simulation ðŸ¤–

This C++ program simulates an AI-controlled mouse navigating through a maze to find cheese. The mouse is intelligent, utilizing backtracking and avoiding previously explored paths. The maze is represented using a 2D array, with distinct symbols for walls, boundaries, the mouse, and the cheese. The mouse moves randomly, yet intelligently, exploring the maze while updating its progress visually. The game terminates upon the mouse successfully reaching the cheese, showcasing its ability to solve the maze efficiently.
