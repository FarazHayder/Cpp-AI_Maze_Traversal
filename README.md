# AI Maze Traversal
Welcome to the AI Maze Traversal C++ program repository! This program simulates an AI-controlled mouse navigating through a maze to find cheese.

## About the Program
The AI Maze Traversal program offers the following features:
- **Intelligent Mouse**: The AI-controlled mouse navigates through the maze using backtracking and avoiding previously explored paths.
- **2D Maze Representation**: The maze is represented using a 2D array, with distinct symbols for walls, boundaries, the mouse, and the cheese.
- **Random Yet Intelligent Movement**: The mouse moves randomly yet intelligently, exploring the maze while updating its progress visually.
- **Game Termination**: The game terminates upon the mouse successfully reaching the cheese, showcasing its ability to solve the maze efficiently.

## Getting Started
To run the AI Maze Traversal program, follow these steps:
1. Compile the C++ program "AI_Maze_Traversal.cpp" using your preferred C++ compiler.
2. Execute the compiled binary file to start the program.
3. Observe as the AI-controlled mouse navigates through the maze to find the cheese.
4. The program will terminate upon the mouse successfully reaching the cheese.

## Technologies Used
This AI Maze Traversal program is implemented using C++ and utilizes fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditional statements, and backtracking algorithms.

## Usage
To run the AI Maze Traversal program, compile the C++ source code and execute the compiled binary file:
